# Newsletter_signup_page
Built a newsletter signup page utilizing Node.js and Express.js, integrated with the
Mailchimp API. The aim of the project was to create a seamless and user-friendly interface for users to subscribe to
a newsletter.
This signup page will serve as a crucial tool for our business/organization to gather email addresses and connect with our target audience effectively.
